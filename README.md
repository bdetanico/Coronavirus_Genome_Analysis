# Coronavirus Genome Analysis

The outbreak of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has quickly become a global health emergency.

On 31 December 2019, the WHO (World Health Organization) China Country Office was informed of cases of unknown aetiology pneumonia (unknown cause) detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China.
The Chinese authorities identified a new type of coronavirus, which was isolated on 7 January 2020.
On 30 January the WHO declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
All coronaviruses that have caused diseases to humans have had animal origins, generally in bats, rodents, civet cats and dromedary camels (Rabi FA, Al Zoubi MS, Kasasbeh GA, Salameh DM, Al-Nasser AD. SARS-CoV-2 and Coronavirus Disease 2019: What We Know So Far. Pathogens. 2020;9(3):231). WHO informs that the COVID-19 most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats, and the transmission to humans has likely occurred through an intermediate animal host â€“ a domestic animal, a wild animal or a domesticated wild animal which has not yet been identified.

In this context, it is vital to explore potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 to control COVID-19 spread, as well as, know more about the new coronavirus concerning the SARS-CoV. The current project compared the SARS-CoV-2 genome with SARS-CoV, Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV GX-P4L genomes.

The following genomes were analysed:

1) NC_045512.2 - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1.
2) NC_004718.3 - SARS coronavirus.
3) MN996532.1 - Bat coronavirus RaTG13.
4) MT040333.1 - Pangolin coronavirus isolate PCoV_GX-P4L.
